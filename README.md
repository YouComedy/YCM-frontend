# YCM-frontend

This is the frontend code of [YouComedy.me](http://youcomedy.me). ATM, there is no way to run the local development environment because it requires the backend code, which is missing. We are working to resolve this issue.

## How to build
```
npm i -g grunt
gem install compass
cd common && npm i && grunt deploy
```
